# Assignment week 5
The provided code demonstrates a simple object-oriented example in Dart, a programming language developed by Google. The code consists of three classes, Student, Teacher, and School, and a main function that creates a School object and calls its method to print the information of a Student and a Teacher.

Here is a brief description of the classes and methods:

Student class:
Declares three private variables, name, age, and gradeLevel, accessible via their respective getter and setter methods (not provided in the given code).
Defines a constructor to initialize the name, age, and gradeLevel.
The printStudentInfo method prints the student information to the console.
Teacher class:
Similar to the Student class, it has three private variables, name, age, and subject, accessible via their respective getter and setter methods.
A constructor to initialize the name, age, and subject.
The printTeacherInfo method prints the teacher's information to the console.
School class:
Defines a method createAndPrintInfo, which creates a new student and teacher object, and prints their information using their respective methods.
main function:
Creates an instance of the School class, called school.
Calls the createAndPrintInfo method on the school instance.
The provided code shows how to create classes, instantiate objects, and call their methods. The different class methods, like printStudentInfo and printTeacherInfo, also illustrate functionality encapsulation.
